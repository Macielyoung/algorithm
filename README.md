# algorithm

### This is my algorithm task in the first year of my graduate school.

### The task includes several algorithm implementation with C.

   1. using insert_sort method to sort an unodered list.
   
   2. getting the max value recursively
   
   3. recursive implementation of binary search
   
   4. caculate greatest common divisor with the Euclidean algorithm
   
   5. using quick_sort method to sort an unsorted array
   
   6. choose the k-th minimum value using select2 algorithm
   
   7. sort per unit time job with the deadline and benefit greedly
   
   8. solve the minimum spanning tree problem with Prim algorithm
   
   9. solve the minimum spanning tree problem with Kruskal algorithm
   
   10. forward management of multistage graph
   
   11. seek the optimal binary tree
   
   12. 0/1 knapsack problem（DKNAP）
